# Multi_Output_Regression
Multi output (y1,y2,y3) regression problem 

As in this case, there are 3 outputs and 9 inputs(x1,x2,x3...x9),I have used the Neural Network method of finding the output.
Here I have used MSE Loss to get the most nearby value to the actual Y.

Other method of finding the ouutput is using SVM.

If the number of output is more ie. Suppose there are y1,y2,y3,,,y9 but the no of input column is less then we have to use the GAN method to predict the output of the regression.
